# AbodeAtlas

This project was generated with Angular CLI version 1.0.0.

## Description
Abode-Atlas is a address book built to store address in  a modern way and making search more easy by arranging in alphabetical order just like contacts in phone.

### Angular as my front-end
I built this to broader my knowledge of Typescript and Angular. Being able to code in as many as language possible is my motive here.
